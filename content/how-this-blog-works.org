* How this blog works

Thought I'd share a few details about it because I've been looking for the right 
blogging method for me, and finally I've fallen on something that I think will work 
nicely.

** Org mode
Org mode is a markup format that comes from the Emacs world (although it is used outside
Emacs as well). It's nice to write in because the marked-up text is still very clean 
and readable.

Org mode has some build-in "publishing" capability. It is able to export to HTML. I
use a short emacs-lisp script to achive this. It simply sets a few config vars and
calls the ~org-publish-project-alist~ function to walk the content directory and 
convert my blog posts to html.


#+begin_src elisp
(require 'ox-publish)

(setq org-html-validation-link nil
      org-html-head-include-scripts nil
      org-html-head-include-default-style nil
      org-html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css\" />")


;; Define the publishing project
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list
       (list
	"orgfiles"
        :recursive t
        :base-directory "./content"
        :publishing-directory "./"
        :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
	:with-author nil
	:include-toc nil
        :section-numbers nil
	:time-stamp-file nil)))

;; Generate the site output
(org-publish-all t)

(message "Build complete!")
#+end_src


** Github pages
You can [[https://github.com/larzeitlin/blog][see the repo here]]. Github pages detects the ~index.html~, which then links to the 
other files.

** Thanks 
This was inspired by [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/][System Crafters]]. So thanks to David for that and all his great content.
