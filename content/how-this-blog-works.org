* How this blog works
Thought I'd share a few details about it because I've been looking for the right 
blogging method for me, and finally I've fallen on something that I think will work 
nicely.

** Org mode
[[https://orgmode.org/][org]] is a markup format that is associated with Emacs. The plaintext is very readable and there are some nice features for it built into Emacs. One such feature is the capability to render it to HTML.

I have a directory called ~content~ which I keep all the ~.org~ files in, as well as images. This is am emacs-lisp script I run sets some config to walk the ~content~ directory and convert my blog posts to HTML. It also sets a favicon and uses ~htmlize~ to get syntax highlighting in the code blocks.


#+begin_src elisp
(package-initialize)
(unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))

(package-install 'htmlize)

(require 'ox-publish)

(setq org-html-validation-link nil
      org-html-head-include-scripts nil
      org-html-head-include-default-style nil
      org-html-head (concat "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css\" />"
			    "<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 100 100%22><text y=%22.9em%22 font-size=%2290%22>ðŸ‘»</text></svg>\">"))

(setq org-html-htmlize-output-type 'css)

;; Define the publishing project
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      (list
       (list
	"orgfiles"
        :recursive t
        :base-directory "./content"
        :publishing-directory "./"
        :publishing-function 'org-html-publish-to-html
	:with-author nil
	:include-toc nil
        :section-numbers nil
	:time-stamp-file nil)))

;; Generate the site output
(org-publish-all t)

(message "Build complete!")
#+end_src

* Github pages
With a few click [[https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site][Github Pages]] can be set up to serve static content in a repo. It detects the ~index.html~, which is made from the ~index.org~ file, which then links to the other files. You can [[https://github.com/larzeitlin/blog][see the repo here]].

* Why I like this
I've tried various platforms and static site blog generators (Jekyll, Hugo), as well as building more complicated things from scratch in ClojureScript. These all felt they had too much unnecessary complexity. I considered going fully the other way - just writing it directly into HTML. That's tempting but it's just a bit too unpleasant to read while writing, and a little bit less portable if I want to change to another system in the future. This a happy compromise where it's pretty transparent and flexible while staying really simple.

* Thanks 
This was pretty much copied from the [[https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/building-the-site/][System Crafters]] website. So thanks to David over there for that and all his great content about Emacs.
